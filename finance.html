          <h2>SAVING MONEY</h2>
          <p>There are multiple viewpoints when it comes to saving money. Some people like to spend their money as soon as they get it, living a "I'll get what I want when I want" kind of life. I like this lifestyle choice as it makes every moment in your life exactly what you want it to be. However, I feel that this can also be quite reckless; resulting in the chance of having no money to your name which is an idea I do not vibe with. I prefer a "I'll buy what I want, within reason" kind of life and until I reach the "I have more money than sense" stage of my life which I believe to be attainable through clever uses of my saved money and investing, along with a safe salary from a job.</p>
          <br>
          <p>As a kid, when it came to saving money, I did what any sound-minded person would and put my money into a savings account where I could get 0.5-3% interest over the course of the year which seemed okay, it was better than nothing. Imagine my surprise when I found out what inflation was and how it makes my money depreciate by around 2% a year. In the past 20 years, the American dollar has depreciated by almost 37%. So, as a result of this, the promised interest on your money is cancelled out by inflation giving you no benefit to keeping your money with the bank so that they can use it to become even more ridiculously rich than they already are.</p>
          <br>
          <p>To combat this centralisation that banks have imposed on the world, we can use cryptocurrency; a new form of currency which transcends the capabilities of its predecessor. It is both a hedge against inflation and the top 1% that control everything. It's a way for the common retail investor to have a one up against the house and to be truly in control of all of your assets without the middleman, therefore making you your own bank.</p>
          <br>
          <p>Now, you know that cryptocurrency exists. What currency should you invest in and why?</p>
