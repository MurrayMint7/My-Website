          <h1>GAME DEVELOPMENT</h1>
          <br>
          <h3>A fun fall back.</h3>
          <br>
          <p>For a long time I was confused about who and what I wanted to be. In college, my frail and indecisive mind flipped constantly on what I wanted to be when I grew up. It was a big moment in my life and would set my life on an almost unchangeable course so I had to be smart with my choice. At the time, I had little passion. All I did was play League of Legends and party but somewhere within those two a small flame emerged in the art of Game Design and Development.</p>
          <br>
          <p>I started by thinking of ideas and trying my best to implement them into Unity which at first was slow, I didn't understand the software or the programming language(C#) at all. After making a plethora of unfinished games and terrible code, I gained an actual understanding for the craft. I could implement things without looking online and my code was more comprehensive yet populated a far smaller amount of lines. My games were getting better.</p>
          <br>
          <p>Now, I am in university studying Computer Game Development at MMU and have the plan to get as high grade as I possibly can so that I can get a job easily when the time comes.</p>

          	<h2>IT'S FUN</h2>
  			<p>Game dev can be a really rewarding craft. The time it takes to produce something is immense but when you enjoy what you're doing it flies by. Personally, I've always enjoyed coding the most in game development which is one of the main reasons I find it fun, along with the sense of progression when making a game.</p>
          </div>
          <div class="column2">
            <img src="/Joshsknowledge2/IMG/tick.png" alt="tick" width="50" height="50">
            <h2>IT'S INTERESTING</h2>
  			<p>There are many aspects that make up a game. There is: coding, music, sound effects, level design, lore, art, animation and testing. Each of these can make or break the game meaning each needs care and thought put into it. Usually developers use large teams to balance this out but currently as a solo developer, I must juggle them all which comes with its drawbacks.</p>
          </div>
          <div class="column2">
            <img src="/Joshsknowledge2/IMG/tick.png" alt="tick" width="50" height="50">
            <h2>IT'S CHALLENGING</h2>
  			<p>As I've said, there's a lot of content to cover when developing games which means that its quite challenging, especially as a solo developer. This is a great thing! You don't want your craft to be easy or the rest of your life is going to be mediocre. Challenges require your brain to work hard to overcome and to become better than it was when you woke up. That's life.</p>

            <img src="/Joshsknowledge2/IMG/cross.jpg" alt="cross" width="50" height="50">
            <h2>EFFORT > PROFIT</h2>
  			<p>I am a very profit driven man. Money is power and power is everything so when I think of an occupation, I always think about the effort to profit factor which is how much effort I'm putting in for the profit I'm getting out of it. Over years of game dev I have come to the conclusion that the effort one must put in outweighs the profits one will potentially make from it, therefore being a good fall back job but not a main source of income if you want to be rich.</p>

            <h2>LONG TIME TO LEARN</h2>
  			<p>Due to the sheer amount of things that you need to become proficient in, it takes a large amount of dedicated learning to understand and apply each aspect. For instance, I've been learning game dev on and off for years and I still can not draw at all. Art has never been a strong suit of mine unlike coding and logic which means it takes a lot longer to learn and become proficient at it. However, this is why most games are created in teams rather than solo so that each person can work on what they do best.</p>

            <h2>EMPLOYABILITY DIFFICULTIES</h2>
  			<p>The job ladder for game dev is complicated. Teams are only going to want to employ people who are great at what they do and they only way to show people that is to make a portfolio which displays your abilities. I have been doing this ever since I got into the space and my portfolio is okay but nothing that would sway me if I was shown it by someone else. The space is fairly saturated with game developers so you have to stand out which brings me back to my previous point about effort to money. The average salary for a game developer is &pound38,838, with starting salaries at &pound19K to &pound25K, which is good for a fall back job but doesn't scratch my itch in terms of sufficient money for later life.</p>
